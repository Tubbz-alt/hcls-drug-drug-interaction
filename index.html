	The purpose of this Community Group Report is to provide a
	technical and user-centered foundation for a minimum
	information model for information about potential drug-drug
	interactions. The Report provides non-ambiguous definitions
	for 10 core information items. It also provides 8 detailed
	best practice recommendations related to the 10 core
	information items. The definitions and recommendations are
	shown as both narrative and prototype JSON artifacts using 2
	exemplar potential drug-drug interactions. Twelve user stories
	with related goals illustrate use cases for the information
	model. Adoption of the recommendations by developers of PDDI
	knowledge artifacts will improve the usefulness of the
	artifacts within clinical workflows. Intended downstream
	applications include clinical decision support, drug product
	label enhancement, cohort identification, and other activities
	relevant to protecting patients from harmful drug
	interactions.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Ensuring medication therapy occurs safely and to the maximum benefit for any given patient is of great
    interest to clinicians [[institute-medicine-2006]]. One possible threat to patient safety comes from exposure
    to two or more drugs that may interact (i.e., potential drug-drug interactions or PDDIs), and could therefore
    lead to a clinically observable effect on the patient (i.e., an actual drug-drug interaction). While the effects
    that may occur due to exposure to some PDDIs can benefit patients (e.g., some HIV therapies use a low-dose of ritonavir
    to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered protease inhibitors by inhibiting their metabolism), PDDIs are
    more often a patient safety concern. Clinically important events attributable to PDDI exposure have been identified in multiple studies, with rates ranging from 
    5.3% - 14.3% of inpatients, and up to 231,000 emergency department visits each year in
    the United States alone [[magro-2012]][[cdc-faststats]]. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 studies conducted
    on 3 continents found the median rate of PDDI associated hospital admissions to be 22.2%
    (interquartile range 16.6 - 36.0%) [[dechanont-2014]]. The potential for harm from PDDIs is an international concern reflected in 
    guidance documents of regulatory agencies around the world [[rekic-2017]][[european-medicines-2012]][[usdhhs-2017]]. Moreover, in the United States, PDDI alerting is a criteria included in the so-called Meaningful Use criteria
    for Electronic Health Records [[cms-2013]][[ridgely-2012]]), and population-based strategies for tracking exposure
    are promoted by organizations such as the Pharmacy Quality Alliance [[ahrq-drug-drug]].
  </p>
  <p>
    Clinicians often face barriers to the effective and appropriate management of PDDI exposures [[nabovati-2017]].
    Barriers include PDDI alerts with poor specificity and incomplete clinician knowledge about PDDIs [[abarca-2004]][[van-der-sijs-2006]]. An awareness of the need for PDDI decision support prompts clinicians to use various drug
    knowledge resources including print or online drug information references, drug interaction checking tools, and alerting systems.
    Unfortunately, poor specificity leads clinicians to be overwhelmed by PDDI information that is “difficult to retrieve, sort and
    digest into clinical decision making” [[bottiger-2009]]. PDDI alerts are often  criticized for “over-alerting” that
    obfuscates the most important information, hinders the usability of the decision support system, and leads to alert fatigue
    and clinician dissatisfaction [[bottiger-2009]][[payne-2015]]. Moreover, while many compilations of
    PDDI evidence exist to help improve prescriber and pharmacist knowledge, they are not concordant in their coverage,
    accuracy, and agreement [[wang-2010]][[saverno-2011]][[ayvaz-2015]][[fung-2017]]. Together, these
    shortcomings suggest the need for harmonized approaches for documenting and sharing PDDI information. <strong>The purpose of this Community Group Report is to provide a technical and user-centered foundation for a minimum information model for information about potential drug-drug interactions.</strong>
  </p>
  <section>
    <h2>Need, envisioned workflow, and high-level requirements</h2>
    <p>New information regarding PDDIs is published every day in
      primary sources such as drug product labeling and the scientific
      literature. A PubMed search for publications indexed with the
      Medical Subject Headings keyword “Drug interactions” shows
      growth from a little more than 6,000 publications in the year
      2000 to more than 9,000 publications in 2018. This suggests that
      the body of evidence about PDDIs is overwhelming and dynamic. As
      it is impossible for clinicians to keep up with the PDDI
      evidence base, drug experts generate summaries of PDDI evidence
      from primary sources. These summaries bring PDDI knowledge to
      clinicians in the form of published drug information compendium,
      clinical decision support rules, and interaction checking
      applications.
      <strong>However, there are currently no broadly accepted standards to guide these experts in the organization, content, and presentation of PDDI
        information.</strong>
    </p>

    <p><a href="#PDDI-MI-APPLICATIONS"></a> provides an overview of
      the roles envisioned for a PDDI minimal information model. Drug
      experts would generate summaries of PDDI evidence from primary
      sources using the information elements from the PDDI minimal
      information model. The information elements would cover the
      minimum set of information required for the effective clinical
      management of PDDI exposure. The resulting common representation
      of PDDI summaries would facilitate curation and information
      exchange.  The annotated knowledge artifacts could be shared in
      a knowledgebase and applied to a variety of use cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Downstream applications would process these representations into
      forms amenable for clinical decision support (see
      Section <a href="#ex-pddi-cds-hl7"></a>), drug product label
      enhancement (see Section <a href="#ex-SPL"></a>), to inform
      cohort descriptions useful for generating evidence from
      retrospective health records (see
      Section <a href="#ex-cohort-desc"></a>), and other medication
      safety activities.

      <figcaption>An overview of the role envisioned for a PDDI minimal information model. Starting from the top of the figure, drug experts synthesize drug-drug interaction evidence from pre-clinical studies, clinical studies, and clinical observation into knowledge artifacts annotated using information categories in the PDDI minimal information model. The annotated knowledge artifacts can be shared in a knowledgebase, and applied to a variety of use cases including <a href="#ex-pddi-cds-hl7">clinical decision support</a>, <a href="#ex-SPL">structuring PDDI information in drug product labeling</a>, and to <a href="#ex-cohort-desc">inform cohort descriptions useful for generating evidence</a> from retrospective health records. </figcaption>

    <p>
      To achieve the envisioned roles, the minimal information model
      must be grounded in non-trivial real world use cases. Where
      possible, model elements should draw upon accepted biomedical
      taxonomies and ontologies to represent medications, diagnoses,
      and descriptions of potential adverse reactions. Being
      a <i>minimum</i> information model, the goal is not to represent
      every aspect of a PDDI using formal logic and
      ontologies. Rather, the model should 1) specify the key
      information that is needed for effective clinical decision
      making, and 2) provide recommendations on how to minimize
      ambiguity common to free-text descriptions about PDDIs

    <p>The purpose of this Community Group Report is to provide a

  <h2>Knowledge representation for the minimal information model</h2>

  <p>
    <i>The intended audience for this section includes persons interested in recommendations related to information model knowledge representation. Persons interested in the clinically-oriented application of the information model can skip this section.</i>
  </p>

  <p> 
    The wide range of potential use cases for the information model
    requires flexibility in the knowledge representation. Moreover, the
    number of pre-existing ontologies relevant to this domain clearly
    demonstrates the richness of the domain [[herrero-zazo-2015]]. To
    keep the minimum information model lean and ensure its
    maintainability and usability, it was necessary to develop a clear
    scope for the knowledge representation including 
    issues such as:

    <ul>
      <li> How should terms related to the core information items
	(see <a href="#user-centered-def"></a>) be modeled?</li>

      <li>What is the role of an upper ontology?</li>
      
      <li>What is the relationship between  the core information items and other existing ontologies?</li>

      <li>Should terms from other resources, such as medical terminologies, be reused?</li>

    </ul>

    The following strategies are suggested for the representation of PDDI
    minimal information (see <a href="#kr-process-apdx"></a> for a
    description of the process used to develop these recommendations):

    <ol>
      <li>The Minimum PDDI Information Ontology
	(<a href="https://github.com/MPIO-Developers/MPIO"
	    target="new">MPIO</a>) should be used for the core information
	items relevant to the PDDI domain (see 
	Section <a href="#user-centered-def"></a>). The ontology is
	limited in its semantic richness by design, but remains
	compatible with semantically rich models such as <a target="new"
							    href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/dideo.owL"> the Drug-drug
	  Interaction and Drug-drug Interaction Evidence Ontology
	  (DIDEO)</a> and <a target="new"
			     href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/dinto.owl">the Drug-Drugs
	  Interaction Ontology (DINTO)</a>.
      </li>
      <li> The MPIO is written in
	the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/">Web Ontology
	  Language (OWL 2)</a> [[owl2-overview]]. The individual classes
	in the MPIO are sub-classes of classes provided by
	the <a href="https://github.com/bfo-ontology/BFO/wiki"> Basic
	  Formal Ontology (BFO)</a> upper ontology. This enables
	integration with numerous other ontologies written in OWL 2 that
	use the same upper ontology. This approach fosters integration
	with a number of existing formal ontology efforts including
	DIDEO, DINTO, <a href="http://obi-ontology.org/"
			 target="new">Ontology for Biomedical Investigations</a>, and
	the <a href="http://www.oae-ontology.org/"> Ontology of Adverse
	  Events</a>.


      </li>
      <li>The core PDDI information items in the MPIO are
	all <a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000030">information
	  content entities</a>. This approach is chosen to reflect the
	hypothetical nature of the information represented. As
	abstract descriptions of events and relationships that might occur,
	instances of the PDDI model do not make any claims that these
	interactions must actually exist.  However, as OWL models are
	generally interpreted to discuss objects that exist in the
	world, knowledge representations must take care to avoid
	making these claims of any of the PDDI information. To address
	this problem, MPIO classifies items in the minimal information
	model as <em>information content entities</em>, essentially
	saying that they are &quot;about something&quot; Thus, each
	element of the model essentially exists as a statement about
	the PDDI.  As a result, the OWL 2 entities do not
	refer to the actual material entities or processes. Rather, all
	properties of the core information items are terminological in
	nature and refer to relations between the term and other
	terms.      
      </li>
      <li>An important requirement of the PDDI minimum information model
	is that it allow for integration of terms from existing
	biomedical terminologies such as ICD-10, SNOMED-CT, RxNorm, and
	LOINC. This presents a challenge since these terminologies
	represent similar items at different levels of semantic richness,
	methodological rigor, and semantic commitments. While it is
	highly unlikely that it would be possible to unify all external
	terms semantically at an upper level with the core PDDI
	information items (see
	Section <a href="#user-centered-def"></a>), terms for which a
	human understandable, non-circular, definition exist, MAY be 
	re-used in the MPIO. Re-use SHALL be accomplished by
	representing an information content entity about the object
	referenced by the term. For example, the diagnosis referred to
	by a diagnostic code from ICD 10 would be reused in the MPIO by
	representing an information content entity corresponding to the
	ICD 10 code. Practically speaking, concepts from any of the
	terminologies might be used, but they should be represented
	whenever possible by unambiguous identifiers for both the source
	terminology and the specific concept.

	  <strong>Comment:</strong> Per the recommendation <a href="#bp-drugs-involved">R1 - Explicitly state the drugs involved</a>, value sets for warfarin and NSAIDs are explicitly enumerated. This example states systemic NSAIDs generally and then refers to more specific NSAID formulations in Contextual information/modifying factors (since the interaction is only relevant for bioavailable forms). We note that the drugs involved can be described at various levels of abstraction, from drug classes at one level to more closely defined medicinal product concepts at the other. The information carried by the other attributes of the minimum information model MUST remain clinically accurate for the particular level of abstraction chosen for the interactants. Also, we note that this example explicitly lists the drugs involved. As Appendix <a href=#intro-to-value-sets></a> mentions, this <i>extensional definition</i> is one approach to declaring value sets. It is also possible to define an algorithm that, when executed by a machine (or interpreted by a human), yields a set of such elements. Such a <i>intensional definition</i> is also an acceptable approach to declaring the drugs involved.

    <h2>The overarching use case for the minimum information model</h2>
    <p>
      The overarching use case for a minimum information model for
      representing PDDI information in a clinical context
      is <strong>to provide a technical foundation for effective PDDI
	clinical decision support</strong>. Unfortunately, existing drug
      information sources  generally organize interaction information into
      a more or less narrative format and include only some of the core
      PDDI information elements. To illustrate, consider the PDDI
      between oral anticoagulants and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs) reported in the well-curated French Thesaurus des interactions médicamenteuses PDDI dataset [[ansm-2016]] shown
      in <a href="#NSAID-Example"></a>.
    </p>
    <figure id="NSAID-Example">
      <img src="W3C-Images/NSAID-Example.png">
      <figcaption>PDDI example from a French compendium</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The PDDI narrative shown is structured into short and easy-to-read description and management
      sections. However, the narrative does not satisfy the proposed minimum information model:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a>Drugs Involved</a> - textual, non-standardized, non-coded lists of ingredients that have been
        classified as either NSAIDs or as oral anticoagulants</li>
      <li><a>Clinical Consequences</a> - textual, non-standardized, non-coded mention of “hemorrhage” </li>
      <li><a>Seriousness</a> - not explicit. However, the statement “not recommended” would suggest a risk of clinically significant consequence</li>
      <li><a>Operational Classification Statement</a> - a direct "not recommended" statement
      <li><a>Recommended Actions</a> - avoidance if possible and monitoring otherwise</li>
      <li><a>Evidence About a Suspected Drug-Drug Interaction</a> - no mention</li>
      <li><a>Mechanism of Interaction</a> - textual, non-standardized, mention of gastroduodenal irritation by the NSAID</li>
      <li><a>Contextual Information/Modifying Factors</a> - no mention</li>
      <li><a>Frequency of Exposure to the PDDI</a> - no mention </li>
      <li><a>Frequency of Harm for Persons who have been Exposed to the PDDI</a> - no mention</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As is evident from the listing above, there are four minimum information items that are not provided in the
      narrative (<a>contextual information/modifying factors</a>, <a>frequency of exposure to the PDDI</a>, <a>frequency of harm for persons who have been exposed to the PDDI</a>, and <a>Evidence About a Suspected Drug-Drug Interaction</a>). Contextual information
      would include drug and patient characteristics factors that might increase or mitigate the risk of harm from exposure
      to the interaction drug pair. Such information often complements, and sometimes is based on, information on the
      frequency information items (frequency of exposure to the PDDI and frequency of harm for exposed persons who have
      been exposed). Together, these information items help to inform the clinician about the risk-benefit trade-off of PDDI
      exposure. In fact, it has been shown that effective clinical decision support that improves patient outcomes can be
      built using such information. For example, Tamblyn et al. found that a novel medication clinical decision support system
      that provided patient-specific risk estimates of injury due to falls reduced fall-related injury by 1.7 injuries per 1000
      patients (95% CI 0.2/1000 to 3.2/1000 p=0.02) [[tamblyn-2012]]. Conversely, when a PDDI summary provides no context
      about risk and no frequency information, only clinical decision support alerts based on  simple exposure to the drug
      combination can be built. This leads to highly sensitive but unspecific alerts and is a primary cause of alert fatigue and
      clinician dissatisfaction  [[van-der-sijs-2006]].
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, the PDDI narrative in <a href="#NSAID-Example"></a>
      provides information without citing supporting evidence.
      Previous community efforts concluded that “providing access to the evidence is a critical component
      of weighing the risks and benefits of co-prescribing drugs that have the potential to result in a drug-drug interaction”
      [[tilson-2016]]. Evidence in supporting PDDIs includes physiological and pharmacological observations from
      clinical studies; mechanistic knowledge derived from pre-clinical and clinical studies; and observational data
      including case reports and various non-randomized studies [[utecht-2017]][[brochhausen-2014]]. Evidence
      may be useful for establishing the existence of an interaction without providing information about the potential
      clinical effect. Other evidence can help to answer questions about the associated clinical effects and their magnitude,
      variability, and estimated frequency [[scheife-2015]]. A PDDI representation should cite specific supporting
      evidence items and provide some acceptable appraisal of the total body of evidence [[tilson-2016]].
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrative in <a href="#NSAID-Example"></a> also fails to provide critical information in computable form suitable for creation
      of personalized decision support presentation. The interaction described above notes that the mechanism of the
      interaction involves gastroduodenal irritation by the NSAID, suggesting gastrointestinal hemorrhage as a possible
      consequence. Such an occurrence would seem unlikely to occur for NSAIDs administered topically rather than orally.
      However, this constraint on the applicability of this PDDI is not stated: the formulation of the NSAID
      being described is ambiguous, and the importance of the means of administration is implied, but not stated directly.
      Describing PDDI evidence in terms of drugs in established drug terminologies, such as RxNorm
      (<a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/</a>), will reduce ambiguity and enable computation through rules
      and inference used to turn the PDDI descriptions into actionable content for clinical decision support.
    </p>
    <p>
      By comparing the narrative in <a href="#NSAID-Example"></a> with
      the core elements of the minimum information model, we see that,
      despite being readable, the information provided lacks both the
      structure and semantics necessary for effective decision
      support. Problems like these are not unique to the French
      Thesaurus des interactions médicamenteuses.  For example, a search for the
      same Oral Anticoagulant / NSAID interaction executed at the drug
      ingredient level in the freely accessible database DrugBank
      returns a single statement that vaguely describes the clinical
      effect but with no other information from the core items
      mentioned above:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">“Ibuprofen may increase the anticoagulant activities of Warfarin.”</p>
    <p>
      As <a href="#COUMADIN-warfarin-product-label"></a> shows,
      slightly more information is provided in United States drug
      product labeling than in DrugBank but there are still many
      information gaps relative to the core PDDI information items
      suggested by conference series attendees.[[bristol-myers-warfarin]])
    </p>
    <figure id="COUMADIN-warfarin-product-label">
      <img src="W3C-Images/warfarin-product-label.png">
      <figcaption>An oral Anticoagulant / NSAID PDDI shown at the drug ingredient level
        from the United States drug product label for COUMADIN- warfarin sodium tablet.[[bristol-myers-warfarin]] </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Although missing information is the primary concern for the examples discussed, the minimum information
      model would also increase the utility of narratives that are abundant with information. For example, a
      search for oral anticoagulant / NSAID in the online interaction checking tool provided by Drugs.com returns
      a very detailed narrative that includes mention of clinical effect, mechanism, management options, some
      contextualized risk information, and specific citations of evidence.[[drugs-dot-com-interaction]] In this
      case, the minimum information model would be useful for suggesting how to provide structure and semantics
      to the description to best enable clinical decision support systems through the use of coded drugs names,
      clinical consequences, and contextual information and modifying factors.  The provision of these details
      in a standardized, computable form will facilitate integration of PDDI information with data in a patient's
      electronic health record, thus enabling patient-specific alerting and decision support.

  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <p>
    This Community Group Report provides a concrete, user centered,
    basis for design and implementation activities using the PDDI
    minimum information model. The non-ambiguous definitions
    for <a href="#user-centered-def">core information items</a> are
    consistent with recently published consensus recommendations
    [[scheife-2015]][[payne-2015]] and the results of a separate
    international Delphi study on how to improve the delivery of
    medication alerts within computerized physician order entry
    systems
    [[riedmann-2011]]. The <a href="#recommendations-summary">eight
      minimum information model recommendations</a> are similarly based
    on recently published consensus recommendations
    [[scheife-2015]][[payne-2015]] and an analysis of a wide variety of
    PDDIs and real-world use cases.
  </p>
  <p>
    Detailed descriptions of the PDDIs
    that informed the model, including specific clinical contexts, are
    available in the Appendix
    (see <a href="#decision-trees"></a>). Two example PDDIs were
    annotated with the core information items along with detailed
    recommendations (see Sections <a href="#ex-warfarin-nsaids"></a>
    and <a href="#ex-tki-ppi"></a>. Twelve user stories with related
    goals show how the PDDI minimum information model would support
    various users (see <a href="#spec-user-stories"></a>). A subset of
    the user stories and selected PDDIs were integrated into three
    medication reconciliation use cases (see Section
    <a href="#med-rec-use-cases"></a>).

    The next sub-sections provide a discussion of three potential
    applications of the minimum information that are shown

    <h2>Shareable PDDI Clinical Decision Support Using HL7 Standards </h2>
    <p>
      The creation and maintenance of PDDI clinical decision support
      (CDS) generally requires considerable time and energy from
      highly trained domain experts. An additional need is to
      standardize the electronic health records context that is used
      to trigger CDS services. This can include context parameters
      that currently might not available but that, if present, would
      be useful for increasing the specificity of the PDDI CDS
      alerts. Achieving this sort of standardization is important to
      ensure that PDDI decision support can be implemented across a
      variety of systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) provides a
      possible solution to the challenge of seamless information
      exchange and data interoperability of information resources in
      health care related environments
      [[bender-2013]][[mandel-2016]]. FHIR  provides a collection of 
      specifications for resources 
      in healthcare settings for the purpose of overcoming the data
      exchange challenges in healthcare.  FHIR defines a set of
      standardized data models for health care covering key areas
      including Clinical information, Diagnostics, and
      Medications. For instance, the Medication resource contains
      medication codes, ingredient details, packaging information and
      related information. FHIR resources are API-based, making it
      possible for third party systems to access electronic health
      records data for the purpose of supporting new use cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      FHIR encodings of PDDI information could form the basis of
      information exchange for more standardized PDDI clinical
      decision support. Indeed, a
      new <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=PDDI_CDS"
	     target="new"> HL7 project related to PDDI decision support</a>
      has been recently approved by the
      HL7 <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Clinical_Decision_Support_Workgroup"
	     target="new">Clinical Decision Support</a>
      and <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Pharmacy_WG"
	     target="new">Pharmacy Workgroups</a>. The project seeks to
      develop an implementation guide for PDDI CDS that will specify
      both a knowledge representation format for PDDI logic and CDS
      services for PDDI with electronic health record (EHR)
      systems. Specifically, the implementation guide will include
      specifications for:

      <ol>
	<li>How to represent PDDI logic in the
	  HL7 <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Clinical_Quality_Language"
		 target="new">Clinical Quality Language</a> (CQL) using the FHIR Clinical Reasoning
	  module.</li>
	<li>How to use the emerging <a href="https://cds-hooks.org/"
				       target="new">CDS Hooks</a> standard as a mechanism for
	  electronic health records to request PDDI CDS from CDS
	  services.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      As is stated in
      the <a href="https://github.com/HL7/PDDI-CDS/blob/master/Documents/ProjectScopeStatement/PDDI%20CDS%20PSS%2002-15-2018.docx?raw=true"
	     target="new">project's scope statement</a>, the HL7 PDDI CDS
      project will draw from the technical foundation, PDDI
      information, and user centered design artifacts reported in this
      Community Group Report. It is anticipated that representation of
      PDDI minimal information may  require the creation of new FHIR
      resource(s) (e.g., a resource       to represent drug
      interactions) and/or FHIR profile(s) (e,g, for 
      PDDI context representation). At the time of this writing,
      participation in the PDDI CDS project is open to public
      participation. Person interested in participation can find more

    <h2>Enhancing the Drug-drug Interaction Section of Structured Product Labeling</h2>
    <p>
      Serious consequences for patients could result if information
      about known drug interactions is missing from a drug’s product
      labeling. To address this potential risk, the United States Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated in 2006 that all product
      labels for FDA-approved prescription drugs include clinically
      significant interactions (c.f., CFR 21 201.57(c)(8)), as well as
      the results of pharmacokinetic studies that establish the
      absence of effect (c.f., CFR 21 201.57(c)(13)(C)) [[fda-cfr-21-4]]. Similar requirements have been
      enacted by the European Medicine's Agency for their equivalent
      of product labeling
      called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3248251/"
		target="new">Summary of Product Characteristics</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As mentioned in the section <a href="#overarching-use-case"></a>, drug product
      labeling can contain many gaps in information relative to the
      core PDDI information. Other prior work has shown that many
      known PDDIs are not mentioned in drug labels [[boyce-2013]]. This problem is not unique to United States
      labeling. For instance, Pfistermeister et al. reported that
      critical drug–drug interaction warnings are frequently missing,
      or are mentioned inconsistently in the United States, United
      Kingdom, and German labels of the involved drugs [[pfistermeister-2014]].
    </p>
    <p>
      As is shown <a href="#PDDI-MI-APPLICATIONS"></a>, the PDDI
      minimum information model could help address this issue by making PDDI information reported in product labeling more
      complete and clinically useful. In the United States and other
      parts of the world, the content of a drug's product label is
      written by the company that owns the drug as part of the drug
      approval process. There is currently no information model to
      guide product label authors as they write drug interaction
      information. The PDDI minimum information model could provide
      authors with clear guidance on the core information items that
      they should discuss. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach might require an annotation tool to help authors
      tag the core PDDI information items correctly and
      consistently. Once the PDDI information is authored using the
      minimum information model, it could be published in a
      computer readable format. In the United States, this would 
      currently be accomplished using
      the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/"
	     target="new"> Structured Product Label (SPL)</a> standard. Other
      standards, such as
      the <a href="http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/general/general_content_001849.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac0580bf85bb"
	     target="new"> International Organization for Standardization
	(ISO) for the identification of medicinal products (IDMP)</a>
      serve a similar function outside of the United States. Focusing
      on the United States as case study, SPLs are XML documents
      written using the HL7 SPL specification that the FDA requires
      industry to use when submitting drug product label content (FDA
      2005). The
      HL7 <a href="https://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/rcrim/overview.cfm"
	     target="new">Biomedical Research and Regulation</a> developed
      and maintains the SPL standard. Currently, the SPLs for all drug
      products marketed in the United States are available for
      download from the National Library of Medicine's DailyMed
      resource [[dailymed-about]]. At the time of
      this writing, DailyMed provides access to drug product labeling
      for more than 30,000 prescription products.
    </p>
    <p>
      PDDI information annotated using the minimum information model
      could be published in a computer readable format using what is
      called an SPL <i>indexing file</i>. Indexing files
      provide additional useful information augmenting official FDA
      drug SPLs. Currently, indexing files are used to specify
      pharmacologic classes, billing units, warning letter alerts, and
      other information [[dailymed-indexing]]. Supplemental indexing files including the elements of the
      PDDI minimum information model might be stored in XML and,
      through the use of XSL and XSLT, be used to render the data in
      various formats including HTML, and PDF, and character-delimited
      tables.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="ex-cohort-desc">
    <h2>Highlighting and Filling Gaps in Evidence Needed to Develop PDDI Decision Support</h2>
    <p>
      Existing PDDI knowledge is heterogeneous with respect to
      coverage of the core information elements. For example,
      frequency of exposure and frequency of harm evidence was not
      available for either of the two PDDI examples detailed in this
      Report (see Sections <a href="#ex-warfarin-nsaids"></a>
      and <a href="#ex-tki-ppi"></a>). Other examples of knowledge
      gaps are mentioned in Appendix <a href="#decision-trees"></a>,
      such as the poorly understood mechanism of the PDDI between
      warfarin and Ifosfamide/Etoposide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of the reason that there are many knowledge gaps is that
      many drug interactions are identified in case reports or
      observational studies that provide little or no indication of
      causal mechanisms. Other interactions, especially
      pharmacokinetic interactions, are established based on small
      clinical studies that rarely suggest a clinical
      consequence. Still other interactions might be inferred from the
      pharmacodynamic properties of two drugs, leaving unanswered
      questions about contextual factors that might increase or
      mitigate patient risks. Moreover, gaps in knowledge can exist
      about the risk factors or appropriate management options for a
      given interaction, even when solid evidence is available for its
      existence, the mechanism of its occurrence, and the likely
      clinical consequence from exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The information model can also act as a template for drug
      experts to use while synthesizing PDDI evidence. As the experts
      compile evidence for each of the core information
      categories, critical gaps in knowledge will become apparent.
      These gaps might be used to develop prioritized research agendas
      aimed at providing evidence for clinical recommendations. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, the PDDI model might be used to address knowledge
      gaps through the creation of computable cohort descriptions —
      serialized queries that  combine  concept sets with logical
      operations to extract specific patient sub-populations from a
      clinical data repository. Computable cohort descriptions are a
      cornerstone for research on PDDIs using real world data. A
      recent project showed the feasibility of converting PDDI
      descriptions created as part of this Report to computable cohort
      definitions [[rosko-2017]]. The target for 
      translation was the Atlas clinical research tool created by the
      Observational Data Health and Informatics collaborative. Atlas
      has a powerful interface for creating, running, and sharing
      cohort descriptions [[ohdsi-atlas]]. Once created, the
      cohort descriptions were executed over a clinical dataset for a
      simulated population stored in the OHDSI common data model. The
      code, concept sets, and cohort descriptions for the
      demonstration are stored
      in <a href="https://github.com/dbmi-pitt/iDIA_Rules">a GitHub
	repository</a>
      and <a href="https://github.com/dbmi-pitt/docker-iDIA-Rules">Docker

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This Community Group Report provides motivation and a detailed
    domain analysis for a minimum information model for PDDI
    information. The Report also suggests potential applications of the
    minimum information model that could lead to improvements in
    patient safety with respect to PDDIs. The overarching goal of
    these contributions is to provide a technical foundation for
    effective PDDI clinical decision support. A reference

    <h2>Development Process</h2>

    <p>Toward the goal of developing such a model, a volunteer-based Task Force force was formed by the Health
      Care and Life Sciences Interest Group, an interest group that operates publicly through the World Wide
      Web Consortium (W3C).  This Task Force has taken a user-centered design approach to designing the
      minimal information model through the a series of complementary activities:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Development of decision trees of more than a dozen PDDIs to
	represent  using the new information model.</li>
      <li>Creation of user stories and use cases that define the
        requirements for the minimum information model.</li>
      <li>Definition of guidelines for knowledge representation</li>
    </ol>

	<h2>Selecting PDDIs to implement using the minimum information
	  model</h2>

	<p>Prior work by some members of the Task Force has sought to develop evidence-based clinical
          algorithms that consider a patient’s electronic health record information to provide a clinician
          with actionable information tailored to the patient’s specific context. <sup>1</sup>The algorithms are formulated
          as decision trees to provide concise information including the interaction description, the purported
          mechanism and possible effects, the evidence supporting the mechanism and effects along with citations
          listed in the footnotes. Two sample decision trees illustrating the management options can be found in
          the appendix (see Appendix <a href="#decision-trees">DECISION TREES</a>).</p>
	<blockquote style="font-size: small"><sup>1</sup>The initial decision trees were developed through the “Individualized Drug Interaction Alerts”
          AHRQ grant by Task Force members Dan Malone and John Horn, as well as Phil Hansten (AHRQ Project: R21-HS023826-01;
          Title: Individualized Drug Interaction Alerts; Authors: Daniel C. Malone, University of Arizona; John Horn,
          Philip Hansten, University of Washington).</blockquote>
	<p>The Task Force built on this prior work by selecting PDDIs to demonstrate the new minimum
          information model and then creating decision trees for each of the PDDIs that they selected.
          Task Force drug experts selected the PDDIs and identified contextual information/modifying factors that
          would warrant any of three different recommended actions - <em>No special precautions, Assess risk and take action
            if necessary, and Use only if benefit outweighs risk</em>. Draft decision trees were presented during sub-team
          monthly meetings for thorough discussion. Revisions were made iteratively until the group reached consensus
          on the presented drafts and finalized the decision trees.</p>
	<p>
          The Task Force began with a discussion of how to select the PDDIs for developing decision trees.
          One option was to select the most serious PDDIs. However, it was noted that the seriousness of a PDDI
          depends a great deal on the patient characteristics context. This meant that it would be difficult to
          identify PDDIs that were considered the most serious in all clinical settings and for all patients. An
          alternative approach was to choose PDDIs that would allow the Task Force to demonstrate how the
          information model should be used when facing known issues with PDDI evidence and knowledge. Toward that
          aim, participants were requested to provide suggestions of PDDIs meeting at least one or more of the
          following criteria which follow from the aforementioned information categories suggested by attendees
          of the multi-stakeholder conference meetings/series mentioned in Section <a href="#justification"></a>:

  <h2>Example PDDI:Warfarin + NSAIDs</h2>
  <p>
    Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have antiplatelet effects which
    increase the bleeding risk when combined with oral anticoagulants such as warfarin.
    The antiplatelet effect of NSAIDs lasts only as long as the NSAID is present in the
    circulation, unlike aspirin’s antiplatelet effect, which lasts for up to 2 weeks
    after aspirin is discontinued. NSAIDs also can cause peptic ulcers and most of the
    evidence for increased bleeding risk with NSAIDs plus warfarin is due to upper
    gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

  <li style="text-align: left">Topical diclofenac has relatively low systemic absorption; in one study a topical gel (16 g/day) produced about 6% of the absorption seen with systemic administration of 150 mg/day. A higher than recommended dose of topical gel (48 g/day) produced 20% of a systemic dose of diclofenac. The UK Summary of Product Characteristics for Voltarol Ophtha Multidose Eye Drops states, "No measurable levels of diclofenac could be found in humans after ocular application of diclofenac sodium eye drops". The FDA-approved SPL for Diclofenac Sodium Ophthalmic Solution 0.1% states, "Results from a bioavailability study established that plasma levels of diclofenac following ocular instillation of two drops of Diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution, 0.1% to each eye were below the limit of quantification (10 ng/mL) over a 4-hour period. This study suggests that limited, if any, systemic absorption occurs with Diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution". </li>
  <li style="text-align: left">If the NSAID is being used as an analgesic or antipyretic, it would be prudent to use an alternative such as acetaminophen. In some people, acetaminophen can increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, so monitor the INR if acetaminophen is used in doses over 2 g/day for a few days. For more severe pain consider short-term opioids in place of the NSAID.</li>
  <li style="text-align: left">Proton pump inhibitors and misoprostol may reduce the risk of UGIB in patients receiving NSAIDs and warfarin.</li>
  <li style="text-align: left">Patients with a history of UGIB or peptic ulcer may have an increased risk of UGIB from this interaction. The extent to which older age is an independent risk factor for UGIB due to these interactions is not firmly established, but UGIB in general is known to increase with age.</li>
  <li style="text-align: left">Both corticosteroids and aldosterone antagonists have been shown to substantially increase the risk of UGIB in patients on NSAIDs, with relative risks of 12.8 and 11 respectively compared to a risk of 4.3 with NSAIDs alone [[masclee-2014]]</li>

    Ponatinib is only approved in T315I-positive patients. These TKIs demonstrate pH dependent

    <h2>Workflow for arriving at stories and goals</h2>
    <p>
      User stories and goals were developed in order to showcase how the PDDI minimum information model
      will support users. The Task Force began developing the Stakeholder Description document and
      the PDDI Minimum Information Model User Scenarios document in order to identify key users. These
      stakeholder descriptions and user scenarios were used as the basis for further brainstorming with
      the assistance of a user experience expert to develop a master list of tasks, users, information needs,
      information values, and barriers to drug-drug interaction based decision-making in a variety of situations.
      A core set of user types was selected for development of user stories based on the scope of the minimum
      information model. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To develop the user stories for the core user types, Task Force  members created an
      initial information needs list  and then was supplemented it with user interviews, interview transcripts
      collected as a part of a recently published manuscript on PDDI information needs of drug information
      compendium editors [[romagnoli-2017]], and the published literature. Where possible, user stories
      were based on PDDIs suggested by the Task Force’s PDDI experts. All user stories were reviewed
      during team meetings to solicit feedback and comments. Based on Task Force member suggestions,
      the user stories were edited to make them more clinically relevant, accurate and appropriate. Information
      model items were highlighted based on a color-coded key to indicate the minimum information model
      information item in question.

    <p>
      Patrick is a nursing home consultant pharmacist who is reviewing the
      medications of a readmitted patient, Nancy.  Nancy is a
      <span style="background-color: #d0c7e3">78 year-old
        woman</span> who is being transferred back to her skilled nursing facility
      after a hospital admission for a Clostridium difficile (C. diff)
      infection; prior to the hospital admission, she was prescribed
      warfarin at the skilled nursing facility for <span style="background-color: #d0c7e3">deep vein thrombosis
        (DVT) treatment</span>.  Based on the hospital discharge summary, it
      appears that Nancy was taken off of the warfarin at the hospital
      due to an increased INR, and returned to the skilled nursing
      facility without an order for warfarin.  Patrick sees that a
      potential interaction may occur with the warfarin that Nancy
      had been prescribed prior to her hospitalization, and the
      metronidazole now used to treat her infection, since
      <span style="background-color: #a9d098">metronidazole is a CYP2C9 inhibitor and may increase the
        plasma concentration of warfarin</span>.  A clinical consequence of
      this interaction would be an

        risk of bleeding</span>.  Patrick would like to gather
      <span style="background-color: #dfa99f">management
        recommendations</span> for this interaction prior to contacting Nancy’s
      physician.  He is interested in Nancy’s duration of therapy for
      both the warfarin and the metronidazole, her current risk factors
      for a DVT, and if she is indicated for prophylactic therapy.
      Patrick also wants to know <span style="background-color: #dfa99f">if and when warfarin should be restarted,
        and at what dose, in order to reduce the risk of bleeding due to
        the interaction</span>.  He would also like to know <span style="background-color: #dfa99f">if metronidazole is
        the best option to continue treating Nancy’s C. diff infection,
        or if there is an alternative option that may not interact with
        warfarin</span>.  To gather this information, he reviews Nancy’s
      previous INR values, medication list, and history.  He also
      contacts the hospital to determine whether warfarin
      had been given at any point during Nancy’s stay, if the dosage
      had been adjusted, what other medications she was given, and if
      any of her other medications were discontinued.  He reviews
      his company’s intranet resources for additional information about
      the interaction and possible <span style="background-color: #dfa99f">evidence-based recommendations</span>.

  <h2>Definition of guidelines for knowledge representation</h2>
  
  A sub-team of the task force focused on setting the scope of
  knowledge representation for the minimum information model. A
  series of teleconferences bringing together domain experts,
  biomedical informatics specialists, and knowledge representation
  experts across the task force. Starting with a core set of
  questions, topics were discussed, arguments for different
  approaches were laid out and, agreement among the participants was
  sought. Besides the conversation during the teleconferences,
  participants had the opportunity to add comments and voice their
  opinion to the statements in the document. When the task force
  arrived at a consolidated version, the group voted by
  teleconference and through e-mail. The result of that vote was
  written into a draft document. The final version of the document
  was revised and written as Section <a href=""#KR-discussion""></a>

  <h2>Value Sets to Support PDDI Examples</h2>
  <section id="intro-to-value-sets">
    <h2>Some Background on Concept Identification and 'Value Sets' </h2>
    <p>
      According to the National Library of Medicine, value sets are
      lists of codes and corresponding terms from standard clinical
      vocabularies (such as SNOMED CT®, RxNorm, LOINC® and others), that
      define clinical concepts to support effective and interoperable
      health information exchange.[[NLM-vsac-2019]] Value sets are also
      referred to as "concept
      sets". <a href="#ddi-model-value-sets"></a> shows some of the
      terminology sources that provide codes useful for constructing
      values sets for information items in the PDDI information
      model. Value sets may be <i>explicitly defined</i> by containing a
      terminology code for each term in the value set concepts. They can
      also be <i>intensionally defined</i> using an algorithm that, when
      executed by a machine (or interpreted by a human), yields a set of
      such
      elements. An <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=PDDI_CDS"
		      target="new">HL7 project related to PDDI decision support</a>
      effort is currently underway within HL7. The work has produced a
      draft implementation guide that includes a specification for
      constructing value sets for the drugs included in a
      PDDI.[[HL7-cds-PDDI-draft]]

  <h2>JSON Examples</h2>
  
  <p>Here, we present prototype JSON documents for the two
    example PDDIs described in Section <a href="#examples"></a>. These
    examples should be considered informative (non-normative) and
    subject to revision.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both of the examples below follow the recommendations provided in
    this Community Group Report. The examples are intended to show a
    simple approach to applying the recommendations to PDDIs using
    JSON, the Web Annotation Data Model [[web-annotation-model]], and
    BibJSON [[bib-json]].
  </p>
  <p>
    An entirely different approach that is also compliant with the
    recommendations in this Report is the HL7 CDS Workgroup's draft
    Implementation Guide for PDDI CDS as a service
    [[hl7-pddi-cds-ig-git]]. The Implentation Guide integrates the
    PDDI minimum information model into PDDI CDS using the health
    information technology standards <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/" target="new">FHIR</a>, <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Clinical_Quality_Language" target="new">Clinical Quality Language</a>, and <a href="https://cds-hooks.org/" target="new">CDS Hooks</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following
    non-normative conventions apply to the examples shown below:

    <ol>
      <li> The core information items are represented as key-value pairs.</li>
      <li> The string labels of the core information items (e.g., "drugs involved", "clinical consequences", etc.) are the keys. </li>
      <li> An identifier for the core information item class is provided in the "type" field of the value assocated with each infomation item. For example, the type of any value assigned to "clinical consequences" is "MPIO_0000003".  A persistent URL can be constructed from each identifier by concatenating "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/" to the beginning of the identifier string (e.g., <a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MPIO_0000003" target="new">http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MPIO_0000003</a>.</li>
      <li>A unique URN identifier is used to identify each information item instance in the "id" field of the value assocated with each infomation item.</li>
      <li>The "display" field of the value assocated with each infomation item shows human readable content relevant to the associated information item </li>
      <li>There are many cases the unstructured text in a "display" field refers to an entity that is more clearly defined using a value set. In such cases, the value object has a "concept set references" field that holds a list of objects that can be used to unambiguously associate text mentions with concept sets. These objects use the Web Annotation Data Model [[web-annotation-model]] as follows: </li>
      <ol>
	<li> The type of each object is a Web Annotation Data Model "TextQuoteSelector". </li>
	<li> The value assigned to the Web Annotation Data Model "exact" field is used to indicate the specific text mention that is being mapped </li>
	<li> The value assigned to the Web Annotation Data Model "body" field is an object that links the text mention to a concept set object provided within the JSON document. The concept set object is present in a list value assigned to the "concept sets" key within the same JSON document as the concept set reference. The the "value" field of the "body" of the concept set reference object holds the URN that uniquely identifies the specific concept set.</li>
	<ul><li> As an example, the following "clinical consequences" value has three concept set references for entities mentioned in the description. One for the mention of "gastrointestinal bleeding", one for the mention of "intracranial hemorrhage", and one for the mention of "cerebral hemorrhage". Each concept set reference object points to the exact value set using the URN assigned to the "value" field of the "body".</li>
